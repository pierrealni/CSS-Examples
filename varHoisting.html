	/*Variable declarations are processed before any code is executed. Declaring
	a variable anywhere in the code is equivalent to declaring it at the top.
	This also means that a variable can appear to be used before it's declared 
	(this is usefull only when changing the variable values), when using them,
	they will return undefined.
